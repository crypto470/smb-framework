# **Traffic Flow**

## ðŸ”¹ 1. **Public Users â†’ WAF/CDN â†’ Apps (TLS-protected, DDoS-protected)**

### Flow:

Public users (like customers or API clients) connect to your public-facing web applications.

### Step-by-step:

1. **User request:** A browser or API client sends a request to your domain (e.g., `app.company.com`).
2. **DNS lookup:** The DNS Security layer ensures integrity with **DNSSEC**, protecting against spoofing.
3. **WAF/CDN entry:**

   * The request hits the **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, often combined with a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**.
   * CDN caches static content to speed up delivery.
   * WAF filters malicious traffic â€” blocks SQL injections, XSS, bot abuse, and DDoS floods.
4. **TLS termination:**

   * TLS (HTTPS) traffic is decrypted at the WAF/CDN to inspect payloads.
   * Optionally re-encrypted before being sent to your backend app servers or SaaS services.
5. **Traffic passes to the application**, now verified as safe and legitimate.

### Purpose:

* Protects from **public-facing attacks**.
* Optimizes global performance via CDN caching.
* Ensures all incoming traffic is **TLS-encrypted and sanitized**.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. **Remote Users â†’ ZTNA/VPN â†’ Start VLAN**

### Flow:

This is how employees or trusted users connect securely to internal resources.

### Step-by-step:

1. **User authentication:**

   * Remote user connects using **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** or **VPN** client.
   * Identity verified via **SSO/IdP** with **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**.
2. **Device posture check:**

   * ZTNA ensures only compliant devices (patched, encrypted, secure) are allowed.
3. **Network assignment:**

   * Once authenticated, the userâ€™s traffic enters the **Start VLAN** (onboarding VLAN).
   * Network Access Control (NAC) using **802.1x authentication** places users in the correct VLAN.
4. **Traffic tunneling:**

   * Their traffic is now encrypted inside a VPN/Zero Trust tunnel to HQ or the cloud.

### Purpose:

* Prevents compromised or unmanaged devices from connecting.
* Ensures all remote sessions are **authenticated, encrypted, and policy-enforced**.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. **All VLANs and Endpoints â†’ NGFW â†’ Internet**

### Flow:

All network traffic â€” whether from remote, on-prem, IoT, or guest VLANs â€” is routed through a **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)**.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Routing:** VLANs (Start, IoT, Server, Guest) are segmented logically to prevent lateral movement.
2. **Inspection:**

   * NGFW inspects both inbound and outbound packets.
   * Uses **IPS/IDS** for deep packet inspection and **Geo/IP blocking** for suspicious sources.
3. **Egress control:**

   * Controls which services or destinations users can reach (e.g., blocks unapproved apps).
4. **Logging:** All traffic logs and alerts are sent to the **SIEM** for centralized visibility.

### Purpose:

* Enforces **network segmentation and egress filtering**.
* Prevents malware from exfiltrating data.
* Ensures only approved apps/services communicate externally.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. **SaaS Data â†’ Immutable Backup Storage**

### Flow:

Data from SaaS applications (CRM, HR, email, etc.) is periodically backed up to a **separate, immutable storage tenant**.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Backup service runs** (usually through a SaaS backup vendor).
2. **Data replicated:**

   * Data is stored in another account or region.
   * Marked **immutable** â€” meaning no one (not even admins) can alter or delete it before the retention period expires.
3. **Compliance validation:**

   * Ensures **RPO/RTO** goals are met (Recovery Point / Time Objectives).

### Purpose:

* Protects from **ransomware or insider tampering**.
* Ensures **data availability** even if the SaaS provider or tenant is compromised.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. **Every Layer Sends Logs â†’ SIEM/MDR**

### Flow:

Every system (firewalls, endpoints, SaaS, identity, WAF, etc.) generates **logs** and sends them to the **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Log collection:**

   * Logs from WAF, NGFW, IdP, endpoints, SaaS, etc. are forwarded.
2. **Aggregation & normalization:**

   * SIEM normalizes logs into a standard format.
3. **Analysis:**

   * Correlates events to detect suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed logins + privilege escalation).
4. **Alerting:**

   * When a rule or anomaly triggers, it raises an alert.

### Purpose:

* Provides **real-time threat visibility** across all layers.
* Enables correlation between seemingly unrelated events.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. **SIEM â†’ Alerts/Tickets â†’ SOC Team**

### Flow:

When SIEM or MDR (Managed Detection & Response) detects something unusual, it automatically notifies the **SOC (Security Operations Center)**.

### Step-by-step:

1. **SIEM generates an alert.**
2. **Ticketing integration:**

   * Automatically creates an incident in the SOCâ€™s platform (e.g., PagerDuty, ServiceNow, or Slack).
3. **SOC triage:**

   * Analysts review the alert, investigate logs, and respond.
4. **Response automation:**

   * Some MDRs isolate endpoints, block IPs, or revoke access tokens automatically.

### Purpose:

* Enables **centralized, fast incident response**.
* Reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. **Key Vault Secures All Secrets, Certificates, and Encryption Keys**

### Flow:

The **Key Vault / KMS (Key Management Service)** manages the cryptographic foundation of your security.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Secrets management:**

   * Stores credentials, API tokens, and connection strings securely.
2. **Certificate storage:**

   * Manages TLS/SSL certificates lifecycle (renewal, rotation).
3. **Encryption keys:**

   * Generates and rotates encryption keys for data-at-rest and data-in-transit.
4. **Integration:**

   * SaaS, servers, and automation scripts retrieve secrets programmatically via secure APIs.

### Purpose:

* Ensures that encryption keys and credentials never appear in plaintext in code or config.
* Centralizes **cryptographic governance** (rotation, auditing, lifecycle).
